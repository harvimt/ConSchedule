.h1 ConSchedule as Drupal Module TODO list

.h2 High Priority

* Add a table to the database that allows the "tagging" of date ranges.
** replaces conTimes variables and con day concept
(e.g. index.php?tag=mew2008 will pull up the events for mew 2008.)
** Tags have a name, a set of rooms, and a set of TagDays
** TagDays have a date range (start time, stop time) and a day number
** /schedule and /schedule/kiosk need to take in _GET['date'] _GET['startTime'] _GET['stopTime'] or _GET['tag'] and _GET['day']

.h2 Medium Priority
* Auto-Calculate color of events instead of setting the color set, 18+, normal, or open event as event type
** This will require a database change (deletion of e_color column and addition of "e_event_type" column)

.h2 Low Piority
* userSchedule has a day separator based on con tags rather than midnight.
* ability to re-order rooms

.h2 Optional / Brainstorm
* Allow grouping/filtering by room or name in userSchedule 
(e.g. userSchedule.php?orderBy='room' will group all rooms together, where userSchedule.php?room=0 will only display roomID 0)
* Ability to filter by panelist. Will require a Panelists table and a slight restructure of the Events table. This will also allow multiple panelists to host a single panel.
* Add a compact view option to index that groups rooms together (e.g. a header for "Room 1" with a compact list of all its events - ordered by time, followed by a header for "Room 2," etc). ( could also do something similar as "view room")
* use theming api to allow drupal themes to theme conschedule (for schedule,"view event", and user schedule only probably)

.h2 Completed
* Have the main schedule allow admins to start adding an event from a certain time.
* Add previous/next event links when viewing an event. (could be styled better)
* choose between left-align with padding or center align with no padding for event titles in schedule (I prefer centered no padding, Kaku's code had left-align with padding originally, that's what I've left it as for the moment). (left chosen)
* Add some sort of visual way to know which events a User is signed up for in the Event Schedule, whether by changing the background color or adding a badge or whatever.
* restricted time entry to 30 minute segments.
